Tk::ObjEditor provides a GUI to edit the attributes of an object or
the elements of a simple hash or array.

The editor is a Tk::ObjScanner with additional function to edit data.

When the user double clicks (with left button) on an item, the value
of the item will be displayed in the HList.

Use the right button of the mouse of an element to modify its
value. Depending on the context, you will also be able to delete the
element or to add a sub-element.

This module was tested with perl5.8.4 and Tk 804.025

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
